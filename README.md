## Description

This project develops good implementations in Julia, of the algorithms of the excellent book of Phillip Compeau and Pavel Pevzner,
"Bioinformatics Algorithms: An active learning approach", 2nd and 3th edition.

You can get the print version of the book at http://bioinformaticsalgorithms.com



## Motivation

Bioinformatics algorithms offer many chances to demonstrate  how the flexible anf fast Julia language can be used to implement algorithms in a concise and hopefully easy to understand way that often closely matches the documentation.

## Julia tools for Artificial Intelligence 

The main branch contains a Julia Transformer implementation.
